"Tariff Ruling Has Potential to Disrupt Global Trade"
"LIVE"
"Feb. 20, 2026, 5:38 p.m. ET"
"18m ago"
"Trump Assails Justices and Vows to Maneuver Around Decision"
"Trump blasts the tariff ruling on Truth Social."
"3h ago"
"Some Republican lawmakers laud the ruling, reflecting intraparty angst."
"Trump plans to impose tariffs a different way after his loss at the Supreme Court."
"See more updates ›"
"Zolan Kanno-Youngs"
"Trump is claiming that he does not need to work with Congress on his tariff policy. That is at odds with the opinion just issued by the Supreme Court."
"Colby Smith"
"Trump is seeking to make the case that this ruling will help to reduce uncertainty that has swirled around his trade policy. But economists argue that economic uncertainty is sharply higher now."
"David E. Sanger"
"The timing of the decision is problematic for the president: He heads to China in about five weeks, and the decision will, to some degree, limit his leverage with the world’s second-largest economy."
"Tony Romm"
"Trump confirmed he would sign orders seeking to restore tariffs under a variety of other authorities. He said he would use one set of trade powers to impose an across-the-board global 10 percent tariff."
"Tony Romm"
"The president said they would use another set of powers to open investigations into unfair trade practices, which could yield additional tariffs."
"Zolan Kanno-Youngs"
"For those who might be curious about the importance of this tariff decision, it essentially targets not just an economic tool, but the central tenet of Trump’s domestic agenda and foreign policy."
"Shawn McCreesh"
"Trump says he’d been trying to tread lightly so as not to spook the courts. As he put it, “I wanted to be a good boy.” At the same time, he heaps praise on justices who dissented from the decision."
"Tony Romm"
"One important thing to remember is that the law at issue — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump had used to impose many tariffs — does not mention the word tariffs."
"David E. Sanger"
"Trump’s attack was notable because he didn’t address the core issue of the case — whether Congress granted him the authority he claimed."
"David E. Sanger"
"Trump argued that the decision was motivated by politics, by unnamed foreign interests, and by justices who are “a disgrace to the nation.”"
"Zolan Kanno-Youngs"
"Trump’s comment about being “ashamed” of the Supreme Court justices he has described as “our people” is indicative of his expectation of loyalty from officials in traditionally independent institutions."
"Tyler Pager"
"Trump has launched an all-out assault on the Supreme Court, accusing it of being “swayed by foreign interests.” He offered no details for that claim and did not expand upon it."
"Tony Romm"
"Trump is acknowledging that there are other tools available to impose tariffs, echoing administration officials who have promised they would seek other avenues to tax imports from many countries."
"Tyler Pager"
"Trump is railing against the justices who ruled against him in the case and making the argument that they should not rule against him because he won the presidential election."
"Tyler Pager"
"Trump, in his first public comments on the Supreme Court’s decision, says the ruling is “deeply disappointing and I’m ashamed of certain members of the court.”"
