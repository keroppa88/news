"Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump’s Sweeping Tariffs"
"LIVE"
"Feb. 20, 2026, 11:59 a.m. ET"
"Just Now"
"Ruling Is a Major Setback for the President’s Agenda"
"The ruling is a major setback for President Trump, and he called it a “disgrace.” The White House has said it will use different means to reimpose tariffs."

"UPDATES FROM REPORTERS"
"Talmon Joseph Smith"
"In one respect, it is a setback for the fiscal situation in the U.S. For all of the downsides noted by various business leaders and economists, it also is true that revenue from tariffs buttressed the federal budget."
"Tony Romm"
"It’s important to remember that this case wasn’t just about trade. Tariffs, specifically the ability to enact them on an immediate, boundless and emergency basis, were central to the president’s second term."
"Patricia Cohen"
"Economists have been assessing the effect of a ruling limiting the power to impose tariffs at will, and most have agreed that trading partners should not expect a wholesale change in policy."
"Jeanna Smialek"
"Experts have said for weeks that a Supreme Court decision that pushes back on the Trump administration’s tariffs was unlikely to kill the European Union-United States trade deal."
"Jeanna Smialek"
"Europe will want to “wait and see” what happens after the Supreme Court decision, said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the think tank Bruegel in Brussels."
