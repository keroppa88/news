"Binance Employees Find $1.7 Billion in Crypto Was Sent to Iranian Entities"
"6 MIN READ"
"David Yaffe-Bellany"
"Last year, internal investigators at Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, discovered that people in Iran had gained access to more than 1,500 accounts on the company’s platform."
"Michael Forsythe"
"The investigators also found that about $1.7 billion from two big Binance users had flowed to Iranian entities with links to terrorist groups, according to documents we reviewed."
"David Yaffe-Bellany"
"They raised the issue with senior management at Binance. Within weeks, four of the investigators were either fired or suspended."
"Michael Forsythe"
"For this story, context is key. President Trump is considering bombing Iran. Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, was pardoned by Trump this past October. And the Trump family has in the past year forged close business ties with the company."
"David Yaffe-Bellany"
"Zhao spent four months in prison in 2024 and the United States fined Binance $4.3 billion after the company admitted it violated U.S. sanctions, including facilitating 1.1 million transactions with Iran."
"Michael Forsythe"
"The two accounts where the $1.7 billion originated are from two companies based in Hong Kong. A spokeswoman for Binance said both accounts have been removed from its platform, and that the four employees were not “suspended or terminated for raising compliance concerns.”"
"David Yaffe-Bellany"
"The spokeswoman said that Binance took action to address the issues raised by its investigators, adding that the company did not find evidence of sanctions violations."
