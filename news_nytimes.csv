"U.S. Mortgage Rates Fall Below 6% for First Time in Years"
"3 MIN READ"
"Gregory Schmidt"
"The evidence is patchy on whether lower rates have meaningfully spurred more transactions. Home sales jumped in December but fell back sharply in January."
"Gregory Schmidt"
"More Americans have a mortgage rate above 6 percent than have a rate below 3 percent. That suggests that more homes could come on the market as rates fall."
"Kailyn Rhone"
"The typical first-time home buyer is now 40 years old, according to surveys. In the 1980s, first-time buyers were more than a decade younger."
"Gregory Schmidt"
"In the State of the Union, President Trump highlighted falling mortgage rates “since I took office,” but rates are heavily influenced by factors not in his control."
"Gregory Schmidt"
"Mortgage rates peaked at just under 7.8 percent in October 2023. Today’s lower rates could save homeowners thousands of dollars in mortgage payments."
